      <h3>A time I was blocked on a simple problem...</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p><strong>Writing a sum function</strong></p>
          <hr>
          <p>
            I first sat there and stared at the screen (note to self- if I do this, I need to take a break!). Then I started trying a few things. I wrote the function correctly to start, but because I had stared
            at it for so long, it just looked weird. Like when you stare at a word for too long, it doesn't even look like a word at all. It looks like there are massive spelling errors. (This also happened to me
            loads this week. The word 'sentence' looked wrong. As did 'score'... reflecting back now, if a word starts looking like it's spelt bad, I have probably spent too long on it and need to choose another problem-solving
            technique... after I take a break!!).
          </p>
          <p>
            I then looked back at the content of sprint 3 - arrays, and realised what I had writen was right. Still doubting myself, I left it and came back to it the next day with fresh eyes.
            This problem made me feel so frustrated. I knew that I knew it, but my brain was just not having a bar of it. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I've learnt to not overthink things, but to also take more regular breaks. I find I forget to set my timer and I end up sitting infront of the computer for far too long.

        <h3>A time I elegantly solved a problem...</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p><strong>The Object Methods Katas</strong>- particularly concatMyArray, whereAreYou and deBee</p>
          <hr>
          <p>
            To start with I wrote a list of what I needed to do, like pseudocode, but on paper. After a few initial attempts I used Google.</p>
          <p>
            I felt relaxed through the process. I didn't overthink it. When the code worked, I felt super stoked, but also underwhelmed because it seemed so straight forward.</p>
          <p>
            I've learnt that it doesn't have to be overly complicated. I just need to break it down into smaller chunks. (And I know that we've been told this over and over, but it's actually making sense now.)

        <h3>My confidence in using the following problem-solving techniques...</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pseudocode-</strong> I'm starting to feel more confident with this. I default to scribbling on paper with pen, which is something I need to work on.</li>
            <li><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong> I'm unsure if I have spoken out loud to myself yet when no-one is around. But I definately go and vent to my partner when I am stuck, and that's when I feel the rubber ducky
            method works. I thank him for his help, even though what I am saying is going over his head, and he stares at me blankly back haha. But it definately helps. Eventually I'll cut him out and talk to one of the plants.</li>
            <li><strong>Reading error messages</strong> This has been great. The error messages help point me in the right direction. (e.g 'sentence.split is not a function'. Ohh.. ok, what do I have to change here?? or, 
            'missing ) line 17' Ahhhh... yes.. thank you!!)</li>
            <li><strong>Console.logging</strong> This has been hugely helpful to. To see if my smaller steps I'm taking are leading me in the right direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Googling</strong> This sprint's core content on Growth mindset has been amazing. I have had to Google a lot for the Kata's and usually I would open a page and be faced with words. Normally I would stare at the page,
              try to read it but know that my mind is wandering and nothing is going in. Knowing the principles of Growth mindset & Fixed mindset, I feel it isn't as daunting anymore. That could also be because all the content is starting to sink in more , so I know what to google and what I am looking for.</li>
            <li><strong>Asking your peers for help</strong> This has been hard for me. I get quite anxious about it because 1- I still really struggle with putting it out there that I am stuck, and I am an imposter, and 2- 
              I don't like the thought that I am putting someone out that has there own work to do. I did reached out this week and I will definately do it more. I'm unsure if I can return the favour yet. Still working on my self-confidence. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Asking coaches for help</strong> I feel much more confident asking a coach for help. I know that they are there to help, so I don't feel like I'm putting them out. Plus, they have seen my learning journey
            so far, and can probably see where I am sitting with my knowledge? So I don't feel whakama them knowing that I am in a pickle.</li>
            <li><strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong> I have been reflecting a lot (Especially when I dream haha). Once I have completed a code, I take a breather and then come back and explain to myself 
            the process I took. It seems to help solidify what I have just done. I have also found that the last two live sessions have been great. They have covered material that I had already done, and material that I was
            yet to complete. Going through the material that I had already done was a great way to help imprint my learning even further. This is where I get more of the 'Ah hah!' moments, when I see what I have learnt getting
            explained again.</li>
