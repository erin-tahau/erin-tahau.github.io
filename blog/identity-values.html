        <h2>My Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h2>

      <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>When my oldest son was 8 months old, I had to make the decision to continue to stay home as a stay at home mum, or go back to work. I was weighing up my values of putting my family first by keeping him home and caring for him each day, and my values for my own continued learning and providing for my family.
            Fortunately, my partner and I do shift work and could manage to care for him together, and not have to worry about daycare. By sharing the role, not only was I able to get back into the work force, but I was able to provide for my family financially. It also gave me the chance to miss my family while I was at work, so I was grateful when I was at home, and wanted to give more of myself. For my partner, he had to take on more of a parenting role, which created an even stronger bond between the two of them.
            </p>  
        </div>
        <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>I grew up in a single parent household, and we weren't well off by any stretch. My mother did everything to put my sister and I first by sacrificing so much to give us everything we needed.  From an early age, I have learnt the importance of hard work, the value of money and putting family first. My mum has never been afraid of following through with an idea. She would ask me 'What's the worst that could happen'. I have taken this advice on in my professional life if the reward outweighed the risk.</p>
          <p>My partner loves to freedive, but in doing so, he see's what destruction is doing to our oceans from factory farming. His value has shaped my identity. He doesn't eat red meat or pork. And because I am the main cook in our household, I will only cook chicken, seafood or vegetarian meals. Together we have grown to value the importance of caring for our planet, and we strive to make the changes that we are able to make to support this. </p>

        <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <h4>I'm open to new ideas and new activities-</h4> <p>If I only know one way of doing things, I'm open to hear other ways that may be better. This also helps me take on any feedback, and learn from mistakes.</p> 
          <h4>Creative-</h4> <p>I love that each challenge is creating something to get to an end result. I love the creating process, so to me, I am in my happy place, which helps while I learn.</p>
          <h4>Love of learning-</h4> <p>I love to learn new skills or to build on existing skills. I also like to talk about what I'm learning to others, so passing on my learnings will help solidify my knowledge.</p> 
          <h4>Curious-</h4> <p>I like to really understand something. So even though it may take me longer initially to learn, eventually I usually have a really good grasp of it.</p>
          <h4>Optimistic-</h4> <p>I know that this learning journey is going to be difficult and challenging. But I can see the end goal and know that I will get through any barrier.</p>  
        </div>
        <h3>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <h4>Not good with time management-</h4><p>I can get carried away down the rabbit hole with things, and not stick to the allocated time box. Utilising a timer will definitely help with this.</p> 
          <h4>Jump between tasks-</h4><p>If a task is getting too tedious, I will find something more exciting to do. Also, if I am dreading a task, I will keep putting it off, and do more exciting tasks first.</p> 
          <h4>Disorganised- </h4><p>Mornings with the children are really rushed because I leave the bag packing, teeth brushing, lunch making and my own morning routine till about 7.30am. Cortisol levels are high during the hour leading up to daycare drop off. It can take me a bit to calm down and be in the right frame of mind to learn.</p>
          <p>Also, my note taking is really disorganised. I write what I feel are important snippets of information on random pieces of paper, but days later, I have no idea what anything means because it has no context. This ends up being a time waster and can usually create confusion. **I need to work on this!!**</p>
          <h4>Not Assertive-</h4><p> If I'm learning something new, I lack self-confidence with my knowledge, so I don't like to speak up in case I look stupid in front of others. Therefore, this will create a challenge when I am asked to lead as I would rather take a back seat. 
            Once I am confident with what I know, I am more than happy to lead.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>In my job as a firefighter, I found that a lot of the calls we were going to and what we were witnessing had the potential to affect our well-being. So, I created projects with the hope to improve the well-being of the Firefighters. Everything from individual weight challenges and fitness plans, team building challenges, seminars, daily yoga and meditation and more.</p> 
          <p>There would always be people who would resist partaking and bad-mouth what I was trying to achieve. This would pull me down, as I would only ever have their best interest in the forefront of my mind.</p>
          <p>I would try to persuade people to partake or I would ask other firefighters who I knew got on with the naysayers to try to persuade them. I would also try to bribe people to get involved. More often than not, it wouldn't work.</p>
          <p>After doing a lot of self work and internalising, I now know that the statement <i>"You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink"</i> is completely true! Everyone is on their own path, their own journey, and they will do what they want in their own time. I learnt to embrace the people who are keen, and put my energy into them, as it makes the outcome more rewarding.</p>
