      <h2>What's Margin, Border and Padding??</h2>

    <h3>In this blog post, I will explain what Margin, Border and Padding is in CSS, and I'll do this by using a photoframe analogy.</h3>
    <div class="text-box">
      <p>Below are two pictures of beaches <em id="colored-text">(This is our content)</em></p>
      <div>
        <img src="Pictures/beach-1.jpg" alt="picture of a beach" id="beach-side">
        <img src="Pictures/beach-2.jpg" alt="another picture of a beach" id="beach-front">
      </div>
      <p>
        Imagine that these are photos that you took and you want to hang them on your wall in your room.
        <em id="colored-text">(Your wall being this blog page)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It looks a bit amature as a photographer to just blue tack them next to each other on the wall... 
        They could probably do with a frame?? How about we add one. <em id="colored-text">(Frame being a border)</em>
      </p>
      <div>
        <img class="frame-only" src="Pictures/beach-1.jpg" alt="picture of a beach">
        <img class="frame-only" src="Pictures/beach-2.jpg" alt="another picture of a beach">
      </div>
      <p>
        I used the following declaration in my css file:
      </p>
      <img class="code-pic" src="Pictures/border-code.png">
      <p>Having a photo sitting in a frame looks as if there is no love given to your amazing photographs.</p>
      <p>I'm going to add a mat to my frame <em id="colored-text">(padding)</em> </p>
      <div>
        <img class="frame-mat" src="Pictures/beach-1.jpg" alt="picture of a beach">
        <img class="frame-mat" src="Pictures/beach-2.jpg" alt="another picture of a beach">
      </div>
      <p>This can be achieved by adding padding to img element:</p>
      <img class="code-pic" src="Pictures/border-padding-code.png">
      <p>
        This is starting to look much better, but I would never put two framed photos so close to each other on a wall.
        I would add a bit of space <em id="colored-text">(margin)</em> between them so they're not so cluttered.
      </p>
      <div>
        <img class="finished-pic" src="Pictures/beach-1.jpg" alt="picture of a beach">
        <img class="finished-pic" src="Pictures/beach-2.jpg" alt="another picture of a beach">
      </div>
      <p>And finally to get this style, I set margin top and bottom to 20px, and margin left and right to 50px.</p>
      <img class="code-pic" src="Pictures/border-padding-margin-code.png">
      <p>Now each photograph stands out in its own right!</p>
