      <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <ol>
            <li>
              I always thought I had a learning style, and I couldn't change that. But understanding the growth 
              mindset principles, I now know that, with focused effort, I can take on different learning styles.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prior to this course, I thought I could easily ask for help. While learning more about myself, and 
              reading back on my reflections, and through witnessing how I've been tackling the challenges; I have found that I 
              have always struggled to ask for help. 1- because my ego get's in the way (I don't want people to see I'm struggling, so I keep quiet), 
              and 2- I don't want to be a burden on anyone. I don't want my struggles to weigh someone else down.
            </li>
            <li>
              I've really understood the importance of sleep, and being in the right frame of mind. Sitting in front of the computer 
              after a terrible night with the kids, or not having regular breaks away from the screen, doesn't = more productive work. 
              I have had whole days where I haven't been focused and my output has been minimal. 
              There have been other days when I have been energised and taken regular breaks, and everything seems to click.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            <strong>Values-</strong> Understanding my values has given me insight into why I want to learn, and why I can embrace the suck of being stuck on something, 
            without throwing my toys and walking away.
            One of my values is that I'm curious, and I have found myself in google rabbit holes, really trying to understand 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Empathy-</strong> I understand that everyone is on their own journey and has their own stresses going on in their personal life. So having empathy 
            towards someone who may not be in the best frame of mind, and meeting them with kindness would help the learning environment. 
            Also having empathy towards myself, and understanding that today may not be a good day, so it's ok to not do my best, and tomorrow, I will come back refreshed and try again. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Self-Awareness-</strong> By really being honest with myself, and being aware of why I do things, or might not do things. 
            <br>
            For example, I have found that asking a question gives me feelings of anxiety. Becauseâ€¦.. I'm worried that I'm taking up someone's 
            valuable time? I'm worried they will tell me the question is silly, and I should know the answer? 
            <br>
            If I were to say to a facilitator that I felt this way, I know that I'll be told that everyone is wanting to help, and there are no stupid questions.
            However, even though I know this, I still feel anxious asking, so I think there is a lot more core work that needs to be done to understand the root 
            of this issue. But for now, understanding myself and why I feel a certain way, is the first step to be able to break these feelings of anxiety when reaching out.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            I am all for self improvement, so I enjoy learning about how and why I do certain things. So the core learning was really enjoyable, and insightful.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've found it hard that I couldn't deep dive on the core material because of the timeframes I was under to complete the course material in time. 
            But was able to research enough on each subject to really get a good understanding of each topic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why I enjoy it so much is because this content can be applied to every day life, and what I am learning, I can teach my own kids, so that they can become better learners and people.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            While we are on the course (which is so fast paced and content heavy), it will help me understand myself, my learning style, the importance of rest and reaching out. 
            But to also trust the curriculum. It has also given me tools to manage my negative inner voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the workforce, it will initially help me to be more employable, but then it will help me to become a better employee who is able to work better with others, 
            which will (hopefully) improve the work environment and employee output. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            No. Not at all. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I really find the programming side challenging. And have really enjoyed the core learning. 
            I have found that the core learning has been a welcomed break from the technical learning. But has also helped me to embrace the technical learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            I probably should have spent more time programming. At this stage, a week away from the start of Bootcamp, I feel like I'm not quite where I should be. 
            But I found, especially sprint 4 and sprint 5, come Thursday, my brain is like a bowl of mashed potato. And as much as I try to be productive, I really struggled to focus, to understand, and to even think. 
            And with that, I would finish my day stressed and feeling negative towards my learning.
            Had I programmed the whole 5 weeks instead of learning some very valuable core skills, my foundations journey could have looked a whole lot different, and not in a good way.
