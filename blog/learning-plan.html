      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>Ideally I would like to get involved in the creating and the creative process as a web developer. I like the idea of taking a customers ideas and needs and making it a reality. A long term goal would be to manage people and projects.</p>  
        </div>
        <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>One of my strengths is that I have no qualms about reaching out for help. However, as a person, I am persistent, so if I don't understand something, or if I can't solve a problem, I will keep at it. And probably for too long. (Which can be seen as a limitation during this Dev Academy journey, as there is so much content to get through, that I shouldn't spend more time than I need to on a problem).</p>  
          <p>Another limitation is that I struggle with is that I get lost in reading new material. As in, while I am reading, my mind starts wandering, and I lose focus. I'm reading the words but I'm not taking them in. So I end up wasting time because I have to re-read, and re-re-read everything.</p>
          <p>I have found so far, if there is a new subject with a large page of text that I have to read, I will take snippets from it, and muddle my way through. Then once I get my own understanding, I will go back and read the material with a better understanding. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <div class="text-box">
         <p>I would like to be more confident in myself and my skillset. And to not feel intimidated by sharing what I know (even though there are students who know way more than I do). 
          And I would like to be more assertive as a person, by speaking up when I don't agree with something or if I have differing opinions.</p>
          <p>With the long term goal of managing people and projects, I feel I would need that confidence and assertiveness to be taken seriously, instead of getting trodden over.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>My commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme.</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>I will stick to a routine as much as I can. So far I have been trying to start my day around 9am and work through to 4pm with breaks for appointments, lunch etc. When I haven't reached my day's goal, I would do more work from 7-9pm.
          </p>
          <p>I will ensure that I get enough sleep each night to be able to focus the next day. If I find that I am tired from a bad night's sleep, or if I'm run down, I will schedule in a nap during the day.</p>
          <p>I will continue to exercise as this helps to clear my head</p>
          <p>If things are building up and starting to get to me, I will take a break. Then come back with a to-do list of smaller 'bites' of workload.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>My commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>If I become stuck, I will first try to figure it out on my own by re-reading through what I have done, and googling. I will set my phone timer for 45 mins. If I feel that I am progressing, I will continue with it. If I'm still stuck I will look at threads on discord and reach out if I need to. </p>
        </div>
        <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
        <div class="text-box"> 
          <p>After the two homegroup video sessions, I have had a huge uplift in confidence. Just having the facilitator/s there and available to help is great, and knowing that they are overlooking my work helps to keep me accountable. I enjoyed the personal feedback after sprint 1's reflections.</p>
          <p>Even though this learning journey isn't about comparing myself to others, I would hope that if they see that I am falling behind in workload or knowledge, that they will pull me up and direct me in the right direction.  </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        </h3>
        <div class="text-box">  
          <p>I'm currently undergoing extensive rehab for my knee op, so I have multiple appointments  each week that I need to attend. These should settle down by the time bootcamp comes around, and I will program appointments into my lunch break.</p>
          <p>Daycare drop off is 9am changing to 8.30 when bootcamp starts, so I will be doing those, then pick up will either be at 2.30pm if my partner can get there. However, if it happens that his day shifts fall during a week day, I will pick them up early during the lunch break and drop them to my in-laws.</p>
