        <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            I'm still unsure the direction I am wanting to go with my career pathway. I do know that I want to take my skills and be able to help people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Something that has been growing in my mind is I would like to develop software that assists organisations/companies/businesses to help the wellbeing 
            of their employees. While reflecting on my foundations experience, | have been impressed with the importance put on individual wellbeing. I've also 
            been blown away with the support given by the facilitators and the overall positive environment that is Dev Academy, to help people succeed.
          </p>  
          <p>
            Looking at my current employer as an example, there is a lot of talk about wellbeing, but unfortunately, the help isn't accessed until it's almost too late. 
            I would like to build a program where the kaupapa is to focus on the individual from the beginning and build them up daily 
            to ensure they don't need the 'ambulance at the bottom of the cliff', but so they can thrive. Happy employee = better employee output = happy employer!
          </p>

        <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            Two of my strengths are I don't like to give up and I'm optimistic. So even though the last 5 weeks has been mentally tough, and the following 9 weeks will be 
            even more so, I know that whatever challenge is thrown at me, I will find a way to overcome it.
          </p> 
          <p>
            My limitations are still the same- I struggle to read content and can get easily distracted. I have really tried to work on this during the last few weeks of Foundations, 
            and will continue to work on it during Bootcamp.
          </p> 
          <p>
            Another limitation I have at the moment is that I am struggling with one of my values. This is that I feel I should be doing more with and for my children. During foundations 
            we put our almost 1 year old into daycare while my partner did his two day shifts. And my almost 3 year old's days have increased from 3 to 4. 
            I am struggling with the guilt of putting them into daycare. But I know that they enjoy it and are well looked after. Another limitation is that I am disorganised so getting 
            the kids ready for daycare in the mornings, can be a real chore and like I explained in my earlier learning plan, can get me quite worked up before I have even sat down at the computer. 
          </p>

        <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            This will be speaking in front of the group about the technical material. I'm still not completely confident with the technical aspect, so having to talk about it to others 
            already makes me feel anxious and self-conscious. Hopefully as I progress, my confidence in my skillset will improve and so will my confidence to talk about it.
          </p>  
        </div>  

        <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? </h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            I would like to improve on my confidence, develop leadership skills and be more assertive.
            I would also like to have the confidence to ask questions in lectures even though they may seem silly. 
            But so that I can really get a good understanding of what is being taught, so that I don't fall behind.
          </p>  
        </div>  

        <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            I would expect the Bootcamp team to be upfront and honest with me. If they see that I am falling behind in anyway, they will let me know. 
            I would also hope they will meet my lack of understanding with kindness. And not get too annoyed with me. 
          </p>  
        </div>  

        <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            I want to try and start with a fresh slate and leave my ego in Foundations. If I'm confused about anything, I want to speak up straight away so that I don't have to spend too long later trying to understand in my own time. I want to reach out early if I am stuck on a problem.
            <br>
            I want to  ensure my personal life has more order to make my mornings easier.
            <br>
            I want to ensure I am asleep by 9.30pm each night so that I am set up for the next day.
            <br>
            I want to make sure I set aside family time on the weekends.

          <h2>Foundations Learning Plan</h2>
        </div>
      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>Ideally I would like to get involved in the creating and the creative process as a web developer. I like the idea of taking a customers ideas and needs and making it a reality. A long term goal would be to manage people and projects.</p>  
        </div>
        <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>One of my strengths is that I have no qualms about reaching out for help. However, as a person, I am persistent, so if I don't understand something, or if I can't solve a problem, I will keep at it. And probably for too long. (Which can be seen as a limitation during this Dev Academy journey, as there is so much content to get through, that I shouldn't spend more time than I need to on a problem).</p>  
          <p>Another limitation is that I struggle with is that I get lost in reading new material. As in, while I am reading, my mind starts wandering, and I lose focus. I'm reading the words but I'm not taking them in. So I end up wasting time because I have to re-read, and re-re-read everything.</p>
          <p>I have found so far, if there is a new subject with a large page of text that I have to read, I will take snippets from it, and muddle my way through. Then once I get my own understanding, I will go back and read the material with a better understanding. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <div class="text-box">
         <p>I would like to be more confident in myself and my skillset. And to not feel intimidated by sharing what I know (even though there are students who know way more than I do). 
          And I would like to be more assertive as a person, by speaking up when I don't agree with something or if I have differing opinions.</p>
          <p>With the long term goal of managing people and projects, I feel I would need that confidence and assertiveness to be taken seriously, instead of getting trodden over.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>My commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme.</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>I will stick to a routine as much as I can. So far I have been trying to start my day around 9am and work through to 4pm with breaks for appointments, lunch etc. When I haven't reached my day's goal, I would do more work from 7-9pm.
          </p>
          <p>I will ensure that I get enough sleep each night to be able to focus the next day. If I find that I am tired from a bad night's sleep, or if I'm run down, I will schedule in a nap during the day.</p>
          <p>I will continue to exercise as this helps to clear my head</p>
          <p>If things are building up and starting to get to me, I will take a break. Then come back with a to-do list of smaller 'bites' of workload.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>My commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>If I become stuck, I will first try to figure it out on my own by re-reading through what I have done, and googling. I will set my phone timer for 45 mins. If I feel that I am progressing, I will continue with it. If I'm still stuck I will look at threads on discord and reach out if I need to. </p>
        </div>
        <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
        <div class="text-box"> 
          <p>After the two homegroup video sessions, I have had a huge uplift in confidence. Just having the facilitator/s there and available to help is great, and knowing that they are overlooking my work helps to keep me accountable. I enjoyed the personal feedback after sprint 1's reflections.</p>
          <p>Even though this learning journey isn't about comparing myself to others, I would hope that if they see that I am falling behind in workload or knowledge, that they will pull me up and direct me in the right direction.  </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        </h3>
        <div class="text-box">  
          <p>I'm currently undergoing extensive rehab for my knee op, so I have multiple appointments  each week that I need to attend. These should settle down by the time bootcamp comes around, and I will program appointments into my lunch break.</p>
          <p>Daycare drop off is 9am changing to 8.30 when bootcamp starts, so I will be doing those, then pick up will either be at 2.30pm if my partner can get there. However, if it happens that his day shifts fall during a week day, I will pick them up early during the lunch break and drop them to my in-laws.</p>
