      <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            <strong>Neuro</strong> = neurons (the nerve cells that are the building blocks of the brain and nervous system. <strong>Plasticity</strong> = the brain's malleability. 
            Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt.
          </p>
          <p>
            With repeated physical practice or by accessing memories, the neurons that we are frequently using fire which create stronger connections, and those that rarely get used eventually die . 
            This is the brain changing and adapting to our environment.
          </p>
          <ul><b>The benefits from increasing your neuroplasticity are:</b>
            <li>the ability to learn new things</li>
            <li>the ability to improve on existing knowledge</li>
            <li>it helps to optimise brain function for memory recall, problem-solving and mental flexibility</li>
            <li>the ability to improve mental health- mood and emotional regulation</li>
            <li>the ability to improve movement and coordination</li>
            <li>the ability to re-wire itself and improve damaged connections cause by stroke for example</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

      <h3>How I might engage with Neuroplasticity for my benefit</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>	
            Using the Pomodoro method of learning, the 25 mins of focused learning is important, but the 5 mins off- is where the brain does it's magic. 
            That 5 mins should be used to take a walk or meditate, so that the neuron connections become stronger. It is said that when you sleep, 
            the brain replays the day 60 times faster, over and over, so those neuron connections are working hard, and converting those learnings to memory. 
            This is the same with the Pomodoro 5 mins 'off' study (as long as it isn't used doing another task that requires too much interaction with the brain). 
            During the 5 mins off is when the brain replays the information. This is done 20-30 times faster, as opposed to the 60x when asleep, however, the Neuroplasticity is working straight away on what you have just learnt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, when studying new material and you get the feeling of complete overwhelm, this is your Neuroplasticity at work. This is new connections being created. 
            So over the last 4 weeks, I know that my Neuroplasticity is working hard, because I've had so many of these moments.
          </p>
        </div>
      
      <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>	
            <strong>Continue Learning-</strong> for example- a new language, instrument, traveling, creating and reading
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Get loads of quality sleep-</strong> Sleep=growth of dendrites in the brain. Dendrites are the growths at the end of neurons that help transmit information from one neuron to the next.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Exercise Regularly-</strong> exercise  boosts BDNF (Brain-derived neurotropic factor) which is the compound that acts on neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems to 
            help support exisiting neurons but also plays a role in new neuron formation. BDNF is active in the hippocampus, cortex and basal forebrain - areas that have a major role in learning, 
            memory and higher thinking. Exercise also supports heart health and blood flow to the brain giving the brain the oxygen it needs to function. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Practice Mindfulness-</strong> meditation has been shown to rewire brain circuits that boost body and mind. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Play games-</strong> the brain neuroplasticity improves when challenging yourself with games and puzzles.
          </p>
        </div>
      <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            How our mindset is, affects the way we think about ourselves and our abilities. Someone who has a fixed mindset believes that their intelligence and talents are just that- fixed. 
            They believe that they are born with a certain level of intelligence and natural talent and that's that. What they know and what they can do can't be improved on. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Someone with a Growth Mindset views intelligence and talents as qualities that can be improved through effort and actions and can therefore be developed over time. 
            A Growth Mindset doesn't give up. Where someone with a fixed mindset would take setbacks as failure and quit, or avoid any challenges to avoid the failure altogether.
            A Growth mindset sees 'failings' as temporary and part of their learning journey.

            Learning these new principles made the Technical aspect of this sprint not as daunting. The Tech side is where I would normally struggle, and have to really work hard to focus on learning.
            This week, the Technical side has been exciting and I am embracing the challenge. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This is relevant on my own learning journey, because it makes me want to put in more effort when I am learning. And the focus to learning seems easier because I'm not resisting it.
            It also makes me reflect on myself and listen to what my inner voice is telling me. From this, I can take the negative comments and use them as opportunities to build on myself.
          </p>

      <h3>My Learning Plan and Strategies</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            I've always thought of myself as a tactile learner, and find I stay away from learning through written word. Applying the Growth Mindset here, points me in the right direction to be able to start reading new material and learn from it. 
            I now know that I would have to put certain processes in place i.e.- Pomodoro timer, reflect on the material and explain the material to someone; but I know that my learning style can improve, and that's exciting! 
            Even though the new content that I am learning at the moment is so foreign, and at times over my head, knowing the principles of Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset gives me the confidence in 'trusting the process'.

            <em>A really great reference I used and will continue to use was listening to podcasts from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/robdialjr">Rob Dial's 'The Mindset Mentor'</a> . They are usually 15-20 mins long, but filled with really great and relevant information! </em>
