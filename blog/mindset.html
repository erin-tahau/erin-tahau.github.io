      <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            Neuro = neurons (the nerve cells that are the building blocks of the brain and nervous system. Plasticity refers to the brain's malleability. 
            Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt as a result of experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            With repeated physical practice or by accessing memories, the neurons that we are frequently using fire which create stronger connections, and those that rarely get used eventually die . 
            This is the brain changing and adapting to our environment.
          </p>
          <ul><b>The benefits from increasing your neuroplasticity are:</b>
            <li>the ability to learn new things</li>
            <li>the ability to improve on existing knowledge</li>
            <li>it helps to optimise brain function for memory recall, problem-solving and mental flexibility</li>
            <li>the ability to improve mental health- mood and emotional regulation</li>
            <li>the ability to improve movement and coordination</li>
            <li>the ability to re-wire itself and improve damaged connections cause by stroke for example</li>
          </ul>

      <h3>How I might engage with Neuroplasticity for my benefit</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>	
            Using the Pomodoro method of learning, the 25 mins of focused learning is important, but the 5 mins off- is where the brain does it's magic. 
            That 5 mins should be used to take a walk or meditate, so that the neuron connections become stronger. It is said that when you sleep, 
            the brain replays the day 60 times faster, over and over, so those neuron connections are working hard, and converting those learnings to memory. 
            This is the same with the 5 min Pomodoro break 'off' study (and not doing another task that requires too much interaction with the brain). 
            During the 5 mins off is when the brain replays the information. This is done 20-30 times faster, however, the Neuroplasticity is working straight away on what you have just learnt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, when studying new material and you get the feeling of complete overwhelm, this is your Neuroplasticity at work. This is new connections being created. 
            So over the last 4 weeks, I know that my Neuroplasticity is working hard, because I've had so many of these moments.
          </p>

      <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>	
            <strong>Continue Learning-</strong> for example- a new language, instrument, traveling, creating and reading
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Get loads of quality sleep-</strong> Sleep=growth of dendrites in the brain. Dendrites are the growths at the end of neurons that help transmit information from one neuron to the next.
          </p>
          <p>
            <storng>Exercise Regularly-</storng> exercise  boosts BDNF (Brain-derived neurotropic factor) which is the compound that acts on neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems to 
            help support exisiting neurons but also plays a role in new neuron formation. BDNF is active in the hippocampus, cortex and basal forebrain - areas that have a major role in learning, 
            memory and higher thinking. Exercise also supports heart health and blood flow to the brain giving the brain the oxygen it needs to function. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Practice Mindfulness-</strong> meditation has been shown to rewire brain circuits that boost body and mind. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Play games-</strong> the brain neuroplasticity improves when challenging yourself with games and puzzles.
