      <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>Emotional Intelligence (EI) is the ability to recognize and manage our own emotions as well as the ability to identify, understand, and influence the feelings of others.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>IQ (Intelligent Quotient) is the measure of the intelligence of an individual, obtained by taking tests and comparing that score to the scores of other people in the same age group.</p> 
          <ul>IQ represents abilities such as:
            <li>Visual and spatial processing</li>
            <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
            <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
            <li>Working memory and short-term memory</li>
            <li>Quantitative reasoning</li>
          </ul>
          <p>EQ differs from IQ, because Emotional Intelligence is an individuals response to personal challenges, expressing emotions and interacting with others.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Self-Awareness. The ability to recognize what you’re feeling and also understanding how your emotions and actions can affect others.</li>
            <li>Self-Regulation. Being able to regulate and manage the emotions you’re feeling while waiting for the appropriate time and avenue in how to express them.</li>
            <li>Motivation. Emotionally intelligent people are motivated by things beyond money, fame, or success. They’re also able to understand and desire the need to fulfil their own inner needs and goals. </li>
            <li>Empathy. Having a high EQ means being able to understand what others may be feeling and are going through and responding kindly and thoughtfully.</li>
            <li>Social Skills. Social skills are vital to emotional intelligence. When you’re aware of how you’re feeling, what others are feeling, and able to communicate effectively, you’re ready to interact well with others. 
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <h3>Why is it important?
        </h3>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>EQ is important not only in an individuals personal life, but also in a professional capacity.</p>
          <p>Having a high level of emotional intelligence allows an individual to work better in a team enviroment, Empathise with others, Communicate effectively, Deal with change and Manage Stress and conflict. </p>
          <p>Having Emotional Intellegance gives an individual understanding of their self through recognising, observing and investigating their differing emotions as they arise, and having the skills to dealing with their emotions/thoughts/feelings in a healthy way instead of reacting and/or being controlled by them.</p>
