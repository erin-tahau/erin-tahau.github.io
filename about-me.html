      <h2> Kia Ora Koutou, as you know, my name is Erin Tahau, and I am currently on my Dev Academy journey. </h2>
    <div class="text-box">
      <p>I live in Napier, Hawkes Bay, with my partner Flash, our two boys Maz and Jai, and our 10 month old Rottweiler 'Sas'.</p>
      <p>Prior to starting Dev Academy, I was a Firefighter. However, during my first game of netball for the season (after a few years off) I tore my ACL and meniscus.</p>  
      <p>This means that I can't ride the trucks. But, with every cloud there is a silver lining, and this injury is allowing me to study web development.</p>
      <ul>
        In my spare time I like to:
        <li>Keep fit by going to the gym, playing sport or getting out in nature</li>
        <li>Hang out with my family </li>
        <li>Take our dog down to the beach; and </li>
        <li>Cook (mainly so I can partake in the eating part) </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The picture below is of Te Mata Peak. At the bottom of this Maunga lies Havelock North and Hastings, just 20mins from Napier.</p>
      <p>This is where I grew up, and whenever I see this mountain, I feel grounded.</p>
      <p>I have decided to add this picture to the bottom of each of my blog pages to help me stay grounded, and try to stay in control of my mental and emotional self during my Dev Academy journey.</p>
